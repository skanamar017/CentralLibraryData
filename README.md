# Shhhh! CentralLibraryData

the place CentralLibrary gets its content from.

As a team, fork this repository to an Organization and submit the URL of your fork via the Student Portal. Each teammate will submit the **SAME URL.** 

## Project Overview

Build a series of pipelines that feed the content needed by a comprehensive Library Management System built by the Java group.

This is a Data project matched to the Java project [Central Library](https://github.com/ZCW-Summer25/CentralLibrary.git).

The Java group builds that project, Data, you get to wrangle the data in the datasets below into a form that you agree with Java on. They load it, we get cool software.

## Learning Objectives

- pipelines - for real
- data formats (csv, json)
- wrangling data into useful formats

### Content Datasets

and this is NOT public: https://zcw-students-projects.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/LMSDataForWeek3Project/LMS-DataStuff.zip

It contains the collected data for this project.
You need to get it from an instructor, we're not gonna store it in this github repo, it's too Big.

## The Pipeline Exercises


These are the conceptual sub-projects.
They will be useful in understanding how and what you need to do to provide Java with the data y'all need to make the project complete.
